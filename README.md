 MAMBA MEETS FINANCIAL MARKETS: A GRAPH-MAMBA APPROACH FOR STOCK PRICE PREDICTION

This repository implements the MAMBA model for stock price prediction, combining state-space models (SSM) with a graph-based approach. The goal is to forecast stock prices using a highly efficient model that leverages MAMBA's computational benefits while incorporating graph structures to improve prediction accuracy.
